## üéØ Purpose & Problem

This application was built to solve a common problem for commission-based salespeople: a lack of clarity on the daily activities required to meet a specific income goal. This tool provides a complete sales funnel tracker (Leads -> Deals) and a unique "Projector" feature that calculates the daily work needed based on the user's personal sales metrics and income targets.
